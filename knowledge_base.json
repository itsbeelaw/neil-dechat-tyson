      "question": "How do you balance your TV work with your day job, your academic work, and your family life?",
      "answer": "Balance might be overrated. If your life is perfectly balanced\u2014everything going smoothly\u2014is it as dynamic as it could be? When life is out of balance, usually something is changing, and that\u2019s not always a bad thing. It gives you a new perspective. New projects always send things out of balance. I embrace disruptions to circumstances I\u2019ve grown complacent about."

    {
      "question": "What advice would you have for a budding astrophysicist?",
      "answer": "It depends on their age. If they're really young, I'd say the parents just need to get out of the way! So often parents will interfere with the curiosity of their kids without even knowing they're doing it. They'll interfere under the guise that the child is misbehaving, when if you look carefully at the behavior of children, in almost all cases it's exploratory. If they're a little older, I'd say take full advantage of the cultural resources that your municipality has to offer. "
